# Arch Linux - Setup Script

This script automates the setup process for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), installing essential packages, AUR helper, fonts, and applications for a complete experience. It is supposed to be run on a minimal [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) installation using archinstall.

## 🚀 Usage

1. 🧑‍💻 Clone the repo
2. 🧰 Add run requirements
3. 🏃‍♂️ Run the script

*Or use the following code*
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Qantrex/archinstall-conf
cd archinstall-conf
chmod +x packages-script.sh
./packages-script.sh
```

## Info 

Feel free to customize the script to suit your preferences! 🎨

**(I use Arch btw && it is superior)**
